Originally requested by zewit in Fargoth's stream.
Replaces all patrols with gutter runners and gutter runner decoys.

[h1]Gutter Runner Decoys:[/h1]
Same as normal Gutter Runners but:
- Has 1 HP
- Can't attack you (including jumping) or vanish

Hardly tested but it works. Any bugs pls make a discussion post or comment.

Note: Didn't have time to properly make code good so could have compatibility issues with other mods";
